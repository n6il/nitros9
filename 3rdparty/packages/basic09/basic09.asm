* Basic09 & RunB programs have extended memory module headers. Layout is as
*  follows:
*   Offset  | Name       | Purpose
*   --------+------------+----------
*   $0000   |  M$ID      | Module sync bytes ($87CD)
*   $0002   |  M$Size    | Size of module
*   $0004   |  M$Name    | Offset to module name
*   $0006   |  M$Type    | Type/Language ($22 for RUNB modules)
*   $0007   |  M$Revs    | Attributes/Revision level
*   $0008   |  M$Parity  | Header parity check
*   $0009   |  M$Exec    | Execution offset (start of tokenized RUNB code)
*   $000B   |  ???       | Data area size required
*   $000D   |  ???       | ???
*   $0017   |  ???       | Flags:
*           |            |   x0000000 - 1=Packed, 0=Not packed
*           |            |   0x000000 - ??? but 1 when CRC has just been made
*           |            |   0000000x - 1=Line with compiler error
*           |            |              0=No lines with compiler errors
*   $0018   |  ???       | Size of module name
* NitrOS9 V1.21 mods
* 06/17/94 - Changed intercept routine @ L07B5: Replaced LSL <u0034/COMA/
*            ROR <u0034/RTI with OIM #$80,<u0034/RTI/NOP/NOP 
*          - Changed routine @ start:
*               FROM                TO
*          4   LEAU >$100,u    4   LDW #$100

* Bytes:  15                  15
*          - Changed CLRA/LDB #$01 to LDD #$0001 @ end of start
* 06/22/94 - Changed L0DBB (reset temp buffer to empty state) to use PSHS D
*          - LDA #1 / STA <u007D / LDD <u0080 / STD <u0082 / PULS PC,D
*            (saves 5 cycles) ALSO WORKS AS 6809 MOD

*            just to shorten source
* 06/27/94 - Added 2nd TFM to init routine to clear out $400-$4ff
* 06/28/94 - Changed BRA L5632 @ L5614 to PULS PC,U,A (6809 TOO)
* 12/22/94 - BIG TEST: TOOK OUT NOP'D CODE - SEE IF IT STILL WORKS
*          - IT DOESN'T - MOVED ALL NOPS TO JUST BEFORE ICPT ROUTINE TO
*            SEE IF THE SEPARATION OF CODE & DATA MAKES A DIFFERENCE
*          - THIS APPEARS TO WORK...THEREFORE, SOME REFERENCES TO THE DATA
*            AT THE BEGINNING OF BASIC09 IS STILL BEING REFERRED TO BY OFFSETS
*            IN THE CODE, THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FIXED UP YET.
* 12/23/94 - AFTER FIXING L03F0 TABLE, ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE 'TEST'

*            TSTE (NEXT Integer STEP <>1)
* 11/16/95 - Changed to L345E (REAL NEXT STEP 1) to do direct call to REAL add
*            routine (changed BSR L321E/BSR L34DC to LBSR L3FB1)
*          - As per above, changed same call @ L34A5 (REAL NEXT STEP <>1), and
*            eliminated L321E completely
*          - @ L347E & L34CC, eliminated L3221 calls, replaced BSR L3221's
*            with LBSR L4449 (Real Compare) (in REAL NEXT, both cases)
* 11/25/95 - Remove L50A1 & L509E (calls to REAL Multiply & REAL divide),
*            changed L529B to call them directly (prints exponents?)
* 11/30/95 - Changed L3AF9 to use SUBR (saves 1 byte/9 cyc on RUN (mlsub)
* 12/05/95 - Changed L3A48 (called by REM) to use ABX instead of CLRA/LEAX D,X
*            (used to jump ahead in I-Code to skip remark text)
*          - Attempted to just move L33DF (NEXT) & L34E5 (FOR) Tables to just
*            after L3446 for 8 bit offsets - also removed LSLB @ L33EA
* 02/12/95 - Changed routines around L57EB to skip ORCC if not necessary (blo&
*            bcs)
*          - Changed LEAX to 8 bit from 16 @ L4B89
* 06/07/14 - Changed Date$ to conform with Y2K changes in F$Time. RG
