        nam     BKFHDISK

*
*   CoCo XT Hard Disk Driver  Version 2.0
*   (with formatting capability)
*
*   Same as BBFHDISK, but a different name
*
*   For Western Digital WD1002-WX2 (or WX1) Controller.
*
*   This is a general purpose driver.  It can handle
*   1-4 hard drives, the parameters of which are described
*   in the device descriptors.  The drives may be of different
*   sizes.  This version is optimized for the CoCo 3 under level 
*   2 OS9.  It does not mess with the clock speed -- the native 
*   speed is used.  It also verifies disk writes, and uses 
*   read caching.
*
*   THIS VERSION CAN FORMAT THE HARD DISK!  IT ALSO
*   SUPPORTS WRITE PROTECTION.  IT IS LEVEL-2 SPECIFIC.
