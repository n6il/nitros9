*    Times out if serial port goes idle for more than 1.4 (0.7) seconds.
*    Serial data format:  1-8-N-1

* Entry:
*    X  = starting address where data is to be stored
*    Y  = number of bytes expected

* Exit:
*    CC = carry set on framing error, Z set if all bytes received
*    X  = starting address of data received
*    Y  = checksum
*    U is preserved.  All accumulators are clobbered
