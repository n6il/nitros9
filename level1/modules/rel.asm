** Start of Level2/Level3 code
**
** The boot-loader loads the "kernelfile" from track34 of the disk into
** memory at $26xx and then jumps into it at address $2602. The
** kernelfile is formed by concatenating the modules REL, BOOT, KRN.
** The entry point jumps via the REL module header to label "start".
**
** One function of REL is to copy the kernelfile from $26xx to high
** memory (specifically, to Bt.Start). $1200 bytes are copied.
**
** The size of each of these modules is controlled with filler bytes (eg,
** see label "Filler" below) so that (after relocation):
** REL  starts at $ED00 and is $130 bytes in size
** BOOT starts at $EE30 and is $1D0 bytes in size
** KRN  starts at $F000 and ends at $FEFF (but the 'emod' comes before
**      the end of krn -- refer to the source file for details)
**
** When REL starts, it has NO STACK

* Entry point for REL. Code is currently running at $26xx. Arrive with
* MMU enabled (with 1-1 mapping), ROM disabled, TR=0, FRT=0.
*
* The MMU (which Coco calls Dynamic Address Translator, DAT) maps
* 8Kbyte blocks of physical memory into 8Kbyte regions of the CPU
* address space.
*
* There don't seem to be consistent names for stuff but I try to use:
* Page             - a 256Byte region of memory
* Block            - an 8Kbyte hunk of physical memory
* Map              - an 8Kbyte region of CPU address space. Map 0-7
*                    are addressed when TR=0, Map 8-15 are in use
*                    when TR=1.
* Mapping register - one of 16 registers (8 for TR=0, 8 for TR=1)
*                    that control which block appears in which map.
*
* There are 64 blocks ($00-$3F) on 512K system, 128 blocks ($00-7F)
* on 1MByte system. At the moment we assume 512K.
*
* In order to start krn, need to:
* - put block   0 in map 0 ($0000 in CPU address space)
* - put block   7 in map 7 ($E000 in CPU address space)
* - enable FRT (makes top 512 locations of block 7 permanently
*   mapped at CPU address $FE00 - $FFFF).
*
* Need to use block 7 for the top of memory because that is where
* the mc09 MMU hardware implements the special fixed-RAM-top (FRT)
* functionality that keeps a tiny piece of the NitrOS9 kernel
* permanently mapped into memory.
*
* This is different from the COCO, which uses block $3f. $3f also
* holds the I/O space on COCO whereas for mc09, the I/O space overlays
* and is not affected by the MMU at all.

* The setup below has been reordered compared with the Coco code. This code does
* the copy/branch high before any of the page0 setup, reflecting an earlier code
* version where MMU setup was deferred (and so page0 was not yet mapped). Could restore
* the Coco ordering, if that allows more common code, or just leave it as-is.

*************************************************************************
** Start of Level1 code
**
** The boot-loader loads the "kernelfile" from track34 of the disk into
** memory at $26xx and then jumps into it at address $2602. The
** kernelfile is formed by concatenating modules REL, BOOT, KRN,
** KRNP2, INIT -- and maybe others, depending upon the hardware
** configuration.
** The entry point jumps via the REL module header to label "start".
**
** One function of REL is to copy the kernelfile from $26xx to high
** memory (specifically, to Bt.Start). Bt.Size ($1000-$1080) bytes are
** copied.
**
** Unlike the Level2/Level3 case, the size of each of the modules in the
** kernelfile is not padded.
**
** When REL starts, it has NO STACK
