;;; Entry:  B = The status code to return to the parent process.
;;;
;;; Exit:   The process is terminated.
;;;
;;; F$Exit is the only way a process can terminate itself. F$Exit deallocates the process’ data memory area and
;;; unlinks the process' primary module. It also closes all open paths automatically.
;;;
;;; F$Wait always returns to the parent the status code passed by the child when it exits. Therefore, if the parent
;;; calls F$Wait and receives the status code, it knows the child has died.
;;;
;;; Exit unlinks only the primary module. Unlink any module that is loaded or linked to by the process before
;;; calling F$Exit.
