;;; F$Unlink
;;;
;;; Decrement a module's link count.
;;;
;;; Entry:  U = The address of the module header.
;;;
;;; Exit:   None
;;;
;;; Error:  B = A non-zero error code.
;;;        CC = Carry flag set to indicate error.
;;;
;;; F$Wait suspends the calling process until one of its children terminates. The kerenel returns the child’s
;;; process ID and exit status. If the child terminated due to a signal, the exit status byte in B contains the
;;; signal code.
;;;
;;; If the caller has more than one child, the kernel activates the caller when the first one terminates. Therefore,
;;; you need call F$Wait to detect the termination of each child.
;;;
;;; The kernel immediately reactivates the caller if a child terminates before F$Wait. If the caller has no children,
;;; F$Wait returns an error.
;;; A return from F$Wait with the carry bit set indicates failure; otherwise, the call functioned properly and the
;;; child's exit status resides in B.
