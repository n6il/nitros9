;;; F$AProc inserts a process into the active process queue so that the kernel can schedule the process for execution.
;;; The kernel sorts all processes in the queue by process age (the count of how many process switches have occurred 
;;; since the process’s last time slice). When a process moves to the active process queue, the kernel sets its age
;;; according to its priority. The higher the priority, the higher the age.
;;;
;;; An exception is a newly active process that was deactivated while in the system state. The kernel gives such a process
;;; higher priority because it's typically executing critical routines that affect shared system resources.
