;;; Parse a pathlist.

;;; Entry:  X = The address of the pathlist to parse.
;;;         U = Starting address of the routine’s memory area.
;;;
;;; Exit:   X = The address of the character past the optional "/".
;;;         Y = The address of the last character plus one.
;;;         A = The trailing delimiter character.
;;;         B = The length of the pathlist.
;;;        CC = Carry flag clear to indicate success.
;;;
;;; Error:  B = A non-zero error code.

;;; F$PrsNam scans the input text string for a legal name. It terminates the name with any character that is not a legal name character.
;;; It's useful for processing pathlist arguments passed to a new process.
;;; Because it processes only one name, you need several calls to process a pathlist that has more than one name. 
;;; F$PrsNam completes with Y in position for the next element in the pathlist to parse.
;;; If  Y is at the end of a pathlist, a bad path error returns.
;;; It then moves the pointer in Y past any space characters so that it can parse the next pathlist in a command line.
