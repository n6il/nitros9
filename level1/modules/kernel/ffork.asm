;;; F$Fork
;;;
;;; Links or loads a module and create a new process.
;;;
;;; Entry:  A = The type/language byte.
;;;         B = Size of the optional data area (in pages).
;;;         X = Address of the module name or filename.
;;;         Y = Size of the parameter area (in pages). The default is 0.
;;;         U = Starting address of the parameter area. This must be at least one page.
;;;
;;; Exit:   A = New process I/O number.
;;;         X = Address of the last byte of the name plus 1.
;;;        CC = Carry flag clear to indicate success.
;;;         
;;; Error:  B = A non-zero error code.
;;;        CC = Carry flag set to indicate error.
;;;
;;; F$Fork creates a new child process of the calling process. It also sets up the child process’ memory,
;;; 6809 registers, and standard I/O paths.
;;;
;;; Upon success, X hold the address of the character past the name. For example, before the call:
;;;
;;;   X
;;;  _|__________________
;;; | T | E | S | T | \n |
;;;  --------------------
;;;
;;; And after the call:
;;;
;;;                    X
;;;  __________________|_
;;; | T | E | S | T | \n |
;;;  --------------------
;;;
;;; When the system call starts, it parses the passed name, then searches
;;; the module directory to see if the module is already in memory. If it is,
;;; then F$Fork calls F$Link and inserts it into the active process queue.
;;;
;;; If F$Link fails, then F$Fork calls F$Load to load the module from the current execution directory on the disk.
;;; It looks for a filename that matches the address of module name passed in X. If more than one module exists in the
;;; file, only the first one has its link count set. The first module in a file is the primary module.
;;;
;;; F$Fork then inspects the primary module to determine its data area, then allocates contiguous RAM for that amount.
;;; If the allocation succeeds, F$Fork copies the parameters at U into the data area, then sets the registers for the
;;; child process like this:
;;;
;;;   ------------------  <- Y (Highest address)
;;;  |  Parameter area  |
;;;  |------------------| <- X, SP 
;;;  |                  |
;;;  |     Data area    |
;;;  |                  |
;;;  |------------------| 
;;;  |                  |
;;;  |    Direct page   |
;;;  |                  |
;;;   ------------------  <- U, DP (Lowest address)
;;;
;;; D holds the size of the parameter area in bytes, the PC points to the primary module's execution entry point, and
;;; CC's FIRQ and IRQ mask flags are clear.
;;;
;;; Registers Y and U (the top-of-memory and bottom-of-memory pointers, respectively) always have values at page
;;; boundaries.
;;; If the parent process doesn't specify the size of the parameter area, the size defaults to zero.
;;; The minimum data area size is one page.
;;;
;;; When the shell processes a command line, it passes a string in the parameter area. The string is a copy of the parameter
;;; part of the command line. To simplify string-oriented processing, the shell also inserts an end-of-line character at the
;;; end of the parameter string.
;;;
;;; X points to the starting byte of the parameter string. If the command line includes the optional memory size specification
;;; (#n or #nK), the shell passes that size as the requested memory size when executing F$Fork.
;;;
;;; If any part of F$Fork is unsuccessful, it terminates and returns an error to the caller.
;;;
;;; The child and parent processes execute at the same time unless the parent calls F$Wait immediately after F$Fork.
;;; In this case, the parent waits until the child dies before it resumes execution.
;;;
;;; Be careful when recursively calling a program that uses F$Fork. Another new child process appears with each new execution
;;; and continues until the process table becomes full.
;;;
;;; Don't call F$Fork with a memory size of zero.
