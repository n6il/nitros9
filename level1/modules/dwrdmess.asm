*    Receive a response from the DriveWire server via MESS FIFO
*    4/27/10 AAW - Based on John Linville's example driver
*
* Entry:
*    X  = starting address where data is to be stored
*    Y  = number of bytes expected
*
* Exit:
*    CC = carry set on framing error, Z set if all bytes received
*    X  = starting address of data received
*    Y  = checksum
*    U is preserved.  All accumulators are clobbered
