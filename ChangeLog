M ChangeLog
M level2/coco3/makefile

Updated "3rdparty/packages/sierra/kingsquest2/makefile" to
fix issue with not using the correct dwio.sb and
dwio_becker.sb.

In "level2/coco3/makefile" updated from
"LDSKBECKER      = $(DISTRONAME)_80d_becker.dsk" to 
"LDSKBECKER      = $(DISTRONAME)_becker.dsk"
since the becker boot disks are for use in the drivewire
server and those are not double sided disks.

M 3rdparty/utils/view/makefile
M ChangeLog
M level1/modules/dwread.asm
M level1/modules/dwwrite.asm

Corrected a ENDC that was in the incorrect location in
dwread.asm and dwwrite.asm also moved the 6309 native code
into the H6309 section and changed the IFEQ H6309 to IFNE H6309
so the code would get correctly loaded.  Moved the 57600 6809
code to the default location as it was in the old dwread.asm
and dwwrite.asm before these files got overwritten by the
dwread.asm and dwwrite.asm from HDBDOS project.

Also did some updates to the 3rdparty/utils/view/makefile
but this file is not done yet to try to fix all the problems
with it.

M level2/coco3/cmds/makefile
M level2/coco3_6309/cmds/makefile

Robert Gault found a problem with building the NitrOS-9
project from MinGW related to the level2/coco3_6309/cmds/
makefile not including level2/coco3/cmds/makefile_common
correctly.  Changed the include line to use $(CC368L2)/cmds/
makefile_common in both level2/coco3/cmds/makefile and
level2/coco3_6309/cmds/makefile .  This should help with
this problem.

M ChangeLog
M level2/coco3/cmds/makefile
M level2/coco3_6309/cmds/makefile
A level2/coco3/cmds/makefile_common

Thanks to Bill P. for finding that the commands in
level2/coco3/cmds were being linked with sys6809l1.l when
they should have been being linked with sys6809l2.l .
Also found that the level2/coco3_6309/cmds were also
using the makefile from the level2/coco3/cmds so that
section was also using the sys6809l1.l for linking.

Renamed level2/coco3/cmds/makefile to makefile_common then
created a new makefile which calls makefile_common then
does a LFLAGS          += -l=$(NITROS9DIR)/lib/sys6809l2.l
and then removed the -l=$(NITROS9DIR)/lib/sys6809l1.l from
the makefile_common.

Then updated the level2/coco3_6309/makefile to include
level2/coco3/cmds/makefile_common rather than makefile.
Then added to level2/coco3_6309/makefile the new line
LFLAGS          += -l=$(NITROS9DIR)/lib/sys6309l2.l
and should fix any lose ends there.

format the entire disk image.  This was done to fix some
issues that some people were having.

the archives are created.

M ChangeLog
M 3rdparty/packages/arcadepak/makefile
M makefile

Updated makefile for the arcadepak to now create DW3 &
BECKER boot disks.

Added new make option to the main makefile.  New option
is "make nightlytest"  This option uses environment
variables called TESTSSHSERVER and TESTSSHDIR. This will
allow testing of the nightly upload to a host ssh server
of your choice as well as folder(s) on that account of
your choice.  This was added strictly for testing use.

Also added a check to the makefile at the nightly section
if the user does not have the environment variable
SOURCEUSER set then it will echo a responce saying that
the user needs to set this environment variable before
using this option.

A 3rdparty/packages/arcadepak/smash/empty_smash.txt
A 3rdparty/packages/arcadepak/thexder/empty_thexder.txt

Found a problem with with the makefile related to the
arcadepak not building from the chained make.  Found the
"--no-print-directory" was missing from the make statement
to get the filenames for the sub folders.  Also found empty
labels so created a empty_smash.txt and a empty_thexder.txt
to correct for odd errors when dealing with the empty labels.

Corrected blackcauldron and christmas86 makefile(s) related
to disk creation.  Found that tocgen was being removed by
some of the disk image sections. This has been corrected.

M ChangeLog
M 3rdparty/utils/aaw/mkdskindex

Updated mkdskindex to state that the becker disks are a

disk image for the index.html creation.

2013/01/15 David Ladd
M ChangeLog
M 3rdparty/packages/subsim/makefile

Found a problem in the makefile for subsim. When using a
"make dskcopy", make would try to copy the disk images even
if they did not exist.  Found that the depend "dsk" was not
in the dskcopy section like all the other makefile(s).
Corrected and tested and the disk images are now being
created when you do a "make dskcopy".

M rules.mak

Updated makefiles to fix for incorrectly not finding the rules.mak file.
When running make without the envirornment variable "NITROS9DIR" being set
you would get error's when building the project that "/rules.mak" could not
be found.
This is because the code to set the envirornment variable "NITROS9DIR" is in
the rules.mak which can not be included because of the envirornment variable
not being set. To fix this I put the code needed to set this envirornment
variable before each include for the rules.mak.

This change should not effect people who already have this envirornment
variable set before building the project.

M makefile
M level2/coco3/makefile_common

Added option to main makefile to allow for "make becker" to create
a zip archive of the becker boot disks for use with drivewire4 server.

Updated level2/coco3/makefile_common so that the disk image for coco3
and coco3_6309 becker images aren't referred to as a 80 track double sided
disk.  Reason for this change is to reduce confusion as that the
DriveWire4 server requires single sided disk images for the boot to work
from the HDBDOS "DOS" command.

dw3 and becker boot disks.

Also updated the makefile related to the nightly build to use a
environment variable rather than boisy's fixed username.

At this time the upload of the zip file only works. Specific users ssh
account must have the burst script.

M level1/modules/kernel/krn.asm

Changed the GetMem rountine for Level1 krn. The routine compared
MaxMem against D.MLIM. This seemed to result in unwarranted loss
of memory and prevented at least one game, Interbank Incident, from running.
The comparison was removed resulting in an increase of available
memory. No problems have been noted.

- joydrv_6551L broken, boot failed, no clue why, code didn't change
  Fixed now, works, 2012/11/07 GH

- All tc^3 drive descriptors broken, over write them in the .dsk's with known
  good versions before doing a mb!

Level 1 atari build

  address of its hardware via its path descriptor has been fixed.
- The montype command had a bug-fix and now shows the current monitor type if
  no parameters are given.  Also, the montype.hp file has been updated.

------------------------------------------------------

OS-9 V3.1.0:

- New common version among all releases of OS-9 for the CoCo
- Many commands have been updated and optimized:
   o For size reasons, command help information is no longer embedded in the
     utilites, but is instead available through the helpmsg file in /DD/SYS
   o date, dir, mdir, procs and verify now require a dash (-) before options

  The vdgint_small.io module only contains CoCo 3 graphics code.
- CC3Go has been moved back into the root directory from the CMDS directory.
  This keeps ROM-based users and those who want cc3go in their bootfile from
  having to change the init module, which referenced CMDS/cc3go.
- CC3Go once again references /H0 and /H0/CMDS as paths that it tries to
  chd/chx to upon startup.  This allows for those with floppy boots who
  want to point /DD at their floppy to continue to do so.  Also, if the
  forking of 'shell startup' fails due to lack of a shell file, then
  CC3Go will now try to fork AutoEx instead of jumping to the crash routine.
- Several bugs that crept into IOMan during the last release have been fixed.

------------------------------------------------------

Level 1 Only:
- SYS/password now references /DD instead of /D0

Level 2 Only:
- SCF, Rammer and PipeMan are now made from the NitrOS-9 version source base,
  bringing in new improvements and features from that platform.
- Clock and Clock2 are now unifed once again and are built from the same source
  base as the clocks from NitrOS-9.
- The printer driver is now for the CoCo 3 serial port.  In the previous
  release, it was mistakenly made for the Disto parallel port.
- Window descriptors now have proper initialization count.
- The debug program is now part of the CMDS package.
- With the inclusion of NitrOS-9's SCF, a bug which crashed the system when
  typing CTRL-E or CTRL-C while using shellplus has been fixed.
