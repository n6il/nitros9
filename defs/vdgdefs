               TTL       VDG Interface Definitions

* Notes:
*
* All offsets from 'U' (address of device memory area)
* (see p. 6-9, technical reference: U=start of driver data memory
* NOTE: There is LOTS of stuff which is only used once, and some which
* is not needed.  Here's a list of the un-needed, and un-used (other than
* once)
*
* It would probably be benificial to patch VDGint to fix these problems,
* unless anyone else has ideas as to why VDGint is doing things this way.
*
* Un-needed
* VD.EPlt1  - (2) set to VD.NChar, and then read only
* VD.EPlt2  - (2) set to same as VD.EPlt1, and then unused
* VD.Chr1   - (1) set to same as VD.CChar, and then unused
* VD.PlFlg  - (1) initialized to $08, and unused
*
* Un-used
*
* $1D       - (1) end of SCF memory requirements
* VD.Strt1  - (2) CLRed, and then read (LDD) - left as $0000
* $24-$2B   - (8)
* $33-$34   - (2)
* $7E-$FF   - (130)
*
* Total of 22 (150 in whole page) bytes unneeded or unused.
